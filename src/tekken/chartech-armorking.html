          <p>Armor King's f+1+2 power crush guarantees a valuable oki mixup when it connects.</p>
          <p>f+1+2 knocks down the opponent such that if they get up directly or get up backwards, they get hit by f+1+4
            or a well-timed ff+4.</p>
          <div class="flexwrap">

            <video style="width: 350px" src="{{'/videos/aktech/f+1+2, ff+4.mp4' | url }}" controls></video>
          </div>
          <p>The f+1+4 does 22 damage while the ff+4 does 24 damage. Since the ff+4 timing is very hard to land, going for f+1+4 is recommended.</p>
          <p>Furthermore, ff+4 will also whiff if the opponent does a forward roll while f1+4 will always hit as long as they get up.</p>
          <p>The opponent can avoid being hit by staying on the floor and doing a slightly delayed get-up kick as a punish.</p>
          <p>This is where the mixup comes in; Armor King can hit opponents who stay on the ground by doing f+4.</p>
          <video src="{{'/videos/aktech/f+1+2, f+4.mp4' | url }}" controls></video>
          <p>Even when the opponent gets up and blocks the f+4, Armor King is still left at +3 and can take his turn.</p>
          <p>The risk-reward is quite favorable since the worst that can happen is taking a get-up kick for ~10+ damage
            while Armor King can get extra ~20+ damage when the opponent guesses wrong.
