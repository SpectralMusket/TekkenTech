          <p>A common cheesy string Bryans use is <b>(3,3,4)</b>, which is a mid-high-mid string.</p>
          <p>While this is -12 on block, it is only punishable at the wall due to its huge pushback. Bryans often bait a
            whiff with the pushback and punish accordingly. </p>
          <p>To counter this, either sidestep the last 4 in either direction, or duck the high and interrupt the string.
