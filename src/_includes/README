## Details on layouts

The foundation of the whole webpage layout is **base.njk**.
It includes all the headers, footers, etc.
The content is placed in the main wrapper.

For now there are two types of main layouts that use **base.njk**,
mainly **article.njk** and **articleWithTOC.njk**.

Article inserts a <main> section into the base layout, while the TOC version adds a table of contents to its side. (Note that the *mainWrapper* class is CSS flexbox)


## Grid layout

Later on I intend to add a grid layout version of the base.
