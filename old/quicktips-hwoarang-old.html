          <h2>General Strategy and Playstyle</h2>
          <p><b>Backdash alot</b> against Hwoarang. His powerful moves need him to be up close, so
            backdash and whiff punish when he misses his moves. <br>
            It is recommended to use a fast mid move like a shoulder to whiff punish as Hwoarang's strings
            are generally fast and may interrupt your whiff punish. <br>
            If you are sure his string has ended or if he whiffs a big move (like b+3), then you can go for a big whiff
            punish.
          </p>
          <p>When he tries to close the gap on your backdashing, sidestep and block; his long range moves (like ff+4)
            are linear
            and his powercrush is -14 on block.</p>

          <h2 class="red">(d+3+4, 4) Rage Drive</h2>
          <p>One of Hwoarang's rage drives is a low-mid-mid string that is +7 on block and
            leaves the opponent ins crouch and himself in RFF,
            so Hwoarang effectively gets a free mixup. <br>
            Many players like to go for RFF b+2, which is a 16f mid punch that leaves him
            +4 on block which allows him to continue pressure.</p>
          <p>Characters who have a punch reversal/parry can parry this,
            because the shortest punch reversal in the game is from 2-8 frames.</p>
          <video src="hwoarang-rd-reversal.mp4" width="600" controls></video>
          <p>Keep in mind whether your character can parry while crouched; Leroy for example can't,
            and has to cancel crouch with a sidestep into b+2.

          <h2>d+3,4</h2>
          <p>Hwoarang's d+3,4 is a low-high that is a natural combo on hit and puts him in stance and plus frames for a
            mixup.</p>
          <p>While this is a good move, if the opponent doesn't know how to deal with it being blocked, it is as
            dangerous as a hellsweep and can be ducked and launched.</p>
          <p>A good opponent will react to his move being blocked and immediately go for the fast high jab or mid
            powercrush in order to stop any punish attempts.</p>
          <p>If your character has good low move from crouch (like Julia or Kunimitsu) this stuffs out Hwoarang's
            reactions and is a sufficiently good punish. Otherwise, only a fast ws move is reliable enough as a punish.
